The JEDI Analysis is a tool do quantify strain in a deformed molecule,
it uses the harmonic approximation to calculate a strain energy for every internal mode. 
The JEDI analysis should be conducted in an individual directory with only the input files specified below. 

Generally the JEDI Analysis needs three different inputs: 
	- the geometry of the relaxed molecule
	- the hessian of the relaxed molecule
	- the geometry of the strained molecules
	
It can be used in two different modes: 
mode 1: using full Q-Chem or ORCA output files
mode 2: using only the raw data

---- Input files - mode 1 ----
- Geometry optimization of the relaxed molecule
  (geom_opt_print=7)
- Frequency calculation of the relaxed molecule in the electronic ground state
  (vibman_print=7 and sym_ignore=true)
- xyz file ("xF.txt") of the geometry of the strained molecule
  (cartesian coordinates in angstrom) 
  in the following formatting: 
		
		number of atoms 
		
		x1	y1	z1
		x2	y2	z2
		x3	y3	z3
		...
	
---- Input files - mode 2 ----
- xyz file ("x0.txt") of the geometry of the relaxed molecule
  (cartesian coordinates in angstrom) 
  in the following formatting: 
		
		final energy
		number of atoms
		
		x1	y1	z1
		x2	y2	z2
		x3	y3	z3
		...
		
- the hessian in cartesian coordinates ("H_cart.txt") of the relaxed molecule
  in matrix format: 
  
		H11	H12	H13
		H21	H22	H23
		H31	H32	H33
		...

- xyz file ("xF.txt") of the geometry of the strained molecule
  (cartesian coordinates in angstrom) 
  in the formatting shown above
	
- a file containing all bonds ("bl.txt") in the following formatting: 
		b1 b2
		b1 b3
		b2 b4
		...

- a file containing all bond angles ("ba.txt") in the following formatting: 
		b2	b1	b3 
		b4	b1	b2
		...

- a file containing all dihedral angles ("da.txt") in the following formatting: 
		b4	b2	b1	b3
		...
