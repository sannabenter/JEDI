Examples and test files
=======================

The JEDI Analysis can be tested by a simple test simulation using the data 
provided in the `Github folder <https://github.com/sannabenter/JEDI/tree/main/test_files>`_. 

Preparation
-----------
The test calculations are done using `Q-Chem <https://www.q-chem.com/>`_. Methanole is calculated 
under a hydrostatic pressure of 1 GPa using the `X-HCFF <https://manual.q-chem.com/5.4/sec_X-HCFF.html>`_ method. 
Both geometries are calculated using the PBE method and a cc-pVDZ basis set. 

To generate the needed input geometries, run ``xyz_gen.py`` with

.. code-block:: console

    python xyz_gen.py path/methanol.out Q_Chem x0

.. code-block:: console

    python xyz_gen.py path/methanol_xhcff_strained.out Q_Chem xF

This should produce geometry files in the following layout. 

.. code-block:: none

    6 

    C 0.7104452060140838 	 -3.680831086776408 	 4.609875799372408
    H 1.2020224863101299 	 -1.8415693555584927 	 3.6898861081518026
    H 0.09229160022123784 	 -3.2590852610224186 	 6.587525122941856
    H -0.944438392723422 	 -4.469566726454301 	 3.595769387893677
    O 2.6605056836328758 	 -5.516751458735709 	 4.456927539841253
    H 4.117526839264233 	 -4.815219618914076 	 5.343311349029762

To generate the file containing the energies of both geometries and the energy difference, run

.. code-block:: console

    python energies_gen.py path/methanol.out path/methanol_xhcff_strained.out Q_Chem 

This should produce an output that looks something like this:

.. code-block:: none

    0.014641748931055076 	 -115.5638587003 	 -115.57850044923106

Lastly, generate a file containing the Hessian with:

.. code-block:: console

    python hess_gen.py path/methanol_freq.out Q_Chem 6


The folder should now contain four files: (1) the Hessian as ``H_Cart.txt``, (2/3) both geometries 
as ``x0.txt`` and ``xF.txt``  and (4) the ``E_Geoms.txt`` files. 

.. note:: 
    As of now, the JEDI Analysis needs to be run in the same folder where the program lies. 
    To properly run the JEDI Analysis in the current version, copy the files to the folder 
    the JEDI program lies in. 

     
Main routine
------------
Run the JEDI Analysis using:

.. code-block:: console

    python energies_gen.py path/methanol.out path/methanol_xhcff_strained.out Q_Chem 

The output is shown and discussed in the `Output Section <https://jedi-analysis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/output.html>`_.

Masking atoms
--------------
To mask atoms (e.g. surface atoms) the to be masked atoms need to be given in the ``jedi_kill_atoms_input.txt`` file. 
If this file is left unaltered, no atoms are ignored.  

Maximum strain
--------------
When analyzing molecule fragments it can be helpful to define a maximum strain that represents the "redest" color in the VMD Analysis.
To apply a maximum strain, run the JEDI Analysis using the --v flag and call the maximum strain in hartree. 

.. code-block:: console

    python jedi.py --v max_strain

This feature was applied in the analysis of molecule fragments, such as in the following figure 
(maximum strains: left : 0.007 hartree; middle : no maximum strain given, default 0.014 hartree; right: 0.057 hartree).

Adding more atoms in VMD Analysis
---------------------------------

In default, the VMD Analysis only displays H, C, N, O and S. 
It is possible to add one or more atoms that should be colored to these tcl scripts.
For this, specify them as individual lines with their RGB values in a file vmd_add.txt.
For adding Ti atoms, for example, vmd_add.txt would look like this:
C 0.5 0.5 0.5
