    "No reward is worth this." (Han Solo)

The raw output shows both the strain energies of the ab initio calculations and the JEDI Analysis. The deviation can be
interpreted as error of the harmonic approximation. This print out is followed by the percentages of the strain 
in each redundant internal mode. Lastly, the isolated strains are added up in each class of redundant internal modes 
(bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles).

VMD Analysis
------------

To visualize the strain distribution an output is generated, that is readable in a 
`VMD Analysis <https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_. The VMD Analysis a tool that
can be used to color code the bonds. JEDI uses a user defined Python routine, that calculates 
the strain in each bond and color codes it according to the strain. For this purpose, 
tcl scripts for use in VMD will be generated automatically ("vmd_bl.tcl" for the bond lengths, "vmd_ba.tcl" for
the bond angles, "vmd_da.tcl" for the dihedral angles and "vmd_all.tcl" for the total distribution).

In the given example a VMD Output of all strain contributions in all modes would look something like this:

.. image:: meoh_vmd.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: alternate text
   :align: center


The dark red O-C-bond indicates the highest strain in this molecule area. A similar VMD readable output
is generated for the indivual modes (bond lengths, angles and torsions).
