Prerequisites and Compilation
=============================

IDSimF is a pure command line tool written in C++ which requires a POSIX compatible environment. It is primarily developed and used on Linux and MacOS systems. However, compilation is possible on recent Windows systems with relatively moderate effort within the Linux Subsystem for Windows.

Git

`Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ is used as version control system for IDSimF. Thus it is also used to clone the `IDsimF source code repository <https://github.com/IPAMS/IDSimF>`_ from `Github <https://github.com/>`_ to a local system where IDSimF should be installed.
