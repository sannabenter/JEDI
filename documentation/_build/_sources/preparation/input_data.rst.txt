Mandatory input
---------------

The JEDI analysis requires four pieces of input: (1) The geometry of the relaxed
molecule, generated by standard quantum chemical geometry optimization techniques,
(2) the Hessian at the relaxed geometry, calculated in a standard frequency calculation
and (3) a mechanically deformed geometry. From this information, it is possible to conduct
the necessary matrix transformations and multiplications. Additionally the JEDI Analyis calculates a 
strain energy based on the harmonic approximation. To evaluate the applicability of the harmonic approximation, the program 
takes (4) the two ab initio energies of the relaxed and strained geometries. It then calculates the deviation of the ab initio energy difference
and the strain energy calculated with the harmonic approximation. 

The JEDI Analysis provides three wrapper scripts to generate the mandatory inputs.
