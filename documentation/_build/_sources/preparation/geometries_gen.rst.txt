The JEDI Analysis takes the geometries of the relaxed and strained molecules as xyz files. 

It provides the wrapper script ``xyz_gen.py``, which extracts the data from output files generated
with Q-Chem or ORCA. The script is to be executed with the following command line input:

.. code-block:: console

    python xyz_gen.py <input_file.out> <program> <geometry>

* <input_file.out> : name of the file containing the geometry 
* <program> : program that generated the output (either Q_Chem or ORCA).
* <geometry> : either x0 (relaxed geometry) or xF (strained geometry)

.. note:: 
    Feature work: implement Gaussian calculations in the wrapper script.


Relaxed geometry (x0)
---------------------
The relaxed geometry is generated by standard quantum chemical geometry optimization techniques; 
standard Density Functional Theory (DFT) or wave function based methods can be used. 
 

Strained geometry (xF)
----------------------
The strained geometry can be displayed by the COGEF, EFEI or RBS
(single point) calculation (see T. Stauch and A. Dreuw, J. Chem. Phys. 140, 134107 (2014)).
