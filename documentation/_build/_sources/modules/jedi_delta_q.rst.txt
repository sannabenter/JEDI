Module: jedi_delta_q
=====================

This script converts the change in cartesian coordinates into 
redundant internal coordinates. It calculates the distances of 
the connected bonds, the bond angles and the torsion angles for 
both geometries. Then the difference in every internal coordinate 
(delta q) is calculated.
