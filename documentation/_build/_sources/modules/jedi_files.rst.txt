Module: jedi_files
==================
 
This script checks if the needed input data is there (x0.txt, xF.txt, E_geom.txt and H_Cart.txt). 
It extracts the atom count and the energies.

Module: jedi_directory
======================

This script is called by ``jedi.py`` in case the ``--d`` flag is specified.
The user has given a directory name, that holds the files with the redundant internal coordinates.
