This script calculates the B-Matrix according to V. Bakken, T. Helgaker, J. Chem. Phys. 117 (20) 2002. 
It takes the list of redundant internal modes generated by ``jedi_rims`` and the cartesian coordinates
of the relaxed geometry. 

Usually the B-Matrix can be printed out by standard quantum chemical programs. But the independent calculation 
of the B-Matrix allows masking atoms, thus, enabling the analysis of adsorbed molecules.
